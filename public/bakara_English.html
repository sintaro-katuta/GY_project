        <h1>What is Baccarat?</h1>
        <p>A type of casino game in which playing cards are used.</p>

            <p>
                Baccarat is a game played by two players, the "banker" and the "player," in which customers bet on who
                will win.<br>
                Since it is a virtual person who is actually playing the game, all the customer can do is make a
                prediction, like a horse race.<br>
                They cannot otherwise intervene in the game (e.g., they do not have the right to choose whether or not
                to draw cards).
            </p>

            <h2>How to count points</h2>
            <p>
                The winner is determined by the sum of the scores of the cards dealt to the player and the banker,
                respectively.<br>
                A (ace) is counted as 1 point, 2~9 are counted as indicated, 10 and all picture cards are counted as 0
                points.。<br>
                No consideration is given to carryovers, and even in the case of carryovers, only the last digit is
                evaluated.<br>
                A score of 9 is the strongest, followed by 8, 7, and so on, with 0 being the weakest score.
            </p>

            <h2>game progression</h2>
            <p>
                The dealers shuffle several sets of cards, which are often done in a special casino card case known as a
                shooter.<br>
                Those who participated in the game bet on whether the "player" side would win or the "hanger" side would
                win.<br>
                The maximum bet amount may be set uniformly by the MAX bet amount shown on the table, or it may be
                "balanced," meaning that the difference between the two side wagers is limited to a certain amount or
                less.<br>
                If the difference exceeds the limit in the "balance," the balance is adjusted by reducing bets on the
                side that is in excess or by asking for additional bets on the side that is in short.<br>
                In the former case, customers who bet on the thin side receive a larger payout and those who bet on the
                thick side receive a smaller payout.<br>
                You can also bet on the outcome of a "tie," which means that the game will end in a draw.<br>
                Ties are side bets, which means that a player can bet on the banker and on the tie at the same time.
                Betting limits are often kept low.<br>
                After betting is completed, both the player and banker sides are dealt two cards each. Then, depending
                on the conditions, a third card is dealt to either or both the player and banker, and the total (last
                digit) is used to determine the winner.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>If, on the first two cards, either total is 8 or 9 points, the game ends immediately as a "natural"
                    and the player with the higher score wins.</li>
                <li>The game also ends when both player and banker have 6 or 7 points on the first two cards, and the
                    player with the higher score wins.</li>
                <li>If none of the above apply, deal a third card according to the following conditions</li>
                <li>If the player side has five or fewer cards, a third card is dealt to the player side.</li>
                <li>The banker side determines whether cards will be dealt according to the following table.</li>
            </ul>
