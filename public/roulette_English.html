        <h1>What is Roulette?</h1>
        <p>
            A casino game where players throw balls into a rotating disk and guess where they will fall.<br>
            Roulette, also known as the queen of casinos, is offered in many casinos.

        <h3>summary</h3>
        <p>
            The wheel (turntable) has evenly divided pockets into which the balls fall and is marked with numbers.<br>
            The pockets are colored red or black, with 0 (00, 000) being green.<br>
            The two main types of wheels are European style and American style. Other types include Mexican style (39
            categories) and French style (37 categories, the same as European style, but with different table
            layouts).<br>
            The sequence of numbers and odds vary depending on the type of wheel.
        <ul>
            <li>European Style 37 categories (1 to 36, 0)</li>
            <li>American Style 38 categories (1 to 36, 0, 00)</li>
            <li>Mexican style 39 categories (1 to 36, 0, 00, 000)</li>
        </ul>
        As for the American style, it is possible to see wheels with different number sequences in different regions.

        <h3>Game Procedures</h3>
        <ol><!--段落番号にCSSで変換-->
            <li>The dealer rings the bell once to inform the players that betting has begun.</li>
            <li>Players place their bets individually.</li>
            <li>The dealer twists the top knob to turn the wheel and throws the ball in the opposite direction of
                rotation.</li>
            <li>The player makes an additional bet. Or, the player changes his or her bet.</li>
            <li>
                The dealer declares the end of betting while a certain amount of time has elapsed and the ball is
                spinning.<br>
                The dealer declares the end of betting while a certain amount of time has elapsed and the ball is
                spinning.
            </li>
            <li>The dealer declares where the ball landed in the pocket (e.g., "Red 9").</li>
            <li>The dealer collects the chips that missed and pays out for the bets that hit the target.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The chips are not regular chips, but color-coded chips for each player, which are used exclusively in
            roulette.<br>
            When placing a bet, you can either place the chips on the table yourself or declare it to the dealer and
            hand over the chips.<br>
            Unclear bets or bets placed after the deadline will be forfeited as fouls.<br>
            The details differ from house to house.<br>
            In many cases, bets can be placed before or after the ball is thrown in, but in some casinos, such as those
            in Asian regions, bets can only be placed before the ball is thrown in. Since this rule greatly
            disadvantages the customer, a mechanical wheel is sometimes used where the ball is thrown in by a machine
            rather than a dealer.<br>
            Many casinos have boards that display a history of the numbers that have been played, which can be referred
            to if necessary. </p>
        <h3>Types of bets</h3>
        <p>
            Roulette bets range from betting twice the payout on red or black, odd or even numbers, to betting 36 times
            the payout on the only certain number coming up, called a one-card bet.<br>
            0 (including 00 and 000) is green and is not considered even or small, and the dealer's total is taken
            against outside bets.
