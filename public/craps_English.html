        <h1>What is craps?</h1>
        <p>
            It is one of the games in which players compete in the roll of two dice.<br>
            The player's side can roll the dice despite playing against the dealer (who rolls the dice in turn).<br>
            The play progression itself is simple, but allows for a great variety of betting options.<br>
            It is played in numerous casinos in the United States and elsewhere.<br>
            In English, it is also called "Seven-Eleven" (meaning 7-11).<br>
            Although it is not a game that can be won by strategy like video poker or blackjack, it is popular with a
            wide range of players, from beginners to experts, because it requires less skill than other games and has
            fewer deductions (the toro's share: house edge, house advantage, and temple change).<br>
            Like baccarat, it is also a game favored by high rollers (those who bet large sums of money on the game).
        </p>
        <h1>basic rule</h1>
        <p>
            First, the case of two players is shown.<br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The first thrower (shooter) rolls two dice.<br>
                This first roll is called the Come-Out Roll.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The thrower wins as soon as 7 or 11 is rolled (Natural or Win)</li>
                <li>The thrower loses immediately if 2, 3, or 12 is rolled (Craps)</li>
                <li>If the thrower immediately loses (craps) if 2, 3, or 12 is rolled. If the thrower rolls 4, 5, 6, 8,
                    9, or 10, he or she changes hands with the opponents and the game continues as is. After the point
                    is determined, the game is called a series until the thrower loses with a 7.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The alternate thrower rolls the dice.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you give a point, the thrower wins at that time.</li>
                <li>If you get a seven, you lose (Seven-Out)</li>
                <li>
                    If it is the other eye, the thrower is switched again, and the two paragraphs are repeated until a
                    decision is made.<br>
                    Points and eyes other than 7 (e.g., 2 or 11) have no bearing on winning or losing in subsequent
                    phases.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        When played in a casino (especially in the United States), the shooter is one of the customers (players).<br>
        Unlike in a two-player game, the same customer continues to serve as the thrower after the points are
        determined. The game proceeds as a series of<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Come Out Roll.<br>
                First 7, 11 to win (natural, win).<br>
                Or 2, 3, 12 and lose (craps)
            </li>
            <li>If any other eye, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, is played, that eye is the point.</li>
            <li>
                After the point is determined, the same customer continues to roll the dice until he or she rolls a
                point and wins or rolls a seven and loses (seven out). This is called a point roll.<br>
                Points and eyes other than 7 (e.g., 2 or 11) have no bearing on winning or losing in this phase.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Customers, including the thrower, place bets, including winning and losing games.<br>
        However, the winners here are only for convenience, and the rules allow not only the non-tossers but also the
        tossers themselves to bet on their own losses.<br>
        When the thrower loses (seven out) by drawing a seven after the point is determined, the thrower is replaced by
        the customer to his or her left.<br>
        In the event of a loss before the points are determined (craps), the thrower is basically never replaced.
        </p>
        <h1>Betting Methods</h1>
        <p>
            Since some payouts in this game do not fit the Japanese term for multipliers, the percentage of payout is
            shown as x-y.<br>
            This means "the opponent makes a multiplier of x, you make a multiplier of y, and the winner takes
            both".<br>
            In other words, the notation 2-1 represents a threefold bet in Japanese.<br>
            The trailing (number) represents the deduction rate (house edge).
        <ul>
            <li>Pass line</li>

            <ul>
                <li>I bet the shooter will win.<br>
                    1-1 (1.41%)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li>Don't pass</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I bet the shooter loses.<br>
                    However, when "12" appears on the come-out roll, the game is a tie.<br>
                    1-1 (1.36%)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li>Come</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The rules themselves are similar to those of the pass line, but they can be joined at any time other
                    than on a come-out roll.<br>
                    If the first roll immediately after betting yields a "7" or "11", you win at that point; if it is a
                    "2", "3" or "12", you lose.<br>
                    If any other number comes up, that number becomes the "point" specific to that bet, and the bet
                    continues.<br>
                    1-1 (1.41%)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li>Don't come</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Reverse of cam.<br>
                    However, as with the don't pass, if the first roll immediately after betting yields "12""3", the
                    game is a tie.<br>
                    1-1 (1.36%)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <li>Odds</li>

            <ul>
                <li>After the "point" is determined at the pass line, don't pass, cam, and don't cam, bet on the point
                    being determined (don't gets a 7).</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Place</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Choose any number from 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 and bet on the total to appear.<br>
                    6,8 is 7-6 (1.52%), 5,9 is 7-5 (4.00%), 4,10 is 9-5 (6.67%)
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I bet that the next roll will produce 2,3,12.<br>
                    7-1 (11.11%)

                <li>
                    I'm betting on a 7 on the next roll.<br>
                    It is the lowest rate of betting in general (high deductible = disadvantageous to the player).<br>
                    4-1 (16.67%)

                    Loses on a combination of 7 or any other 4 (1,3/3,1: for a hard four) or any other 10 (4,6/6,4: for
                    a hard ten).<br>
