        <h1>What is Poker?</h1>
        <p>
            Poker is a genre of game played with playing cards.<br>
            It is a game characterized by psychological warfare.<br>
            Players create bands (roles or means) with five cards and compete on the strength of their roles.<br>
            When playing as gambling, cash is exchanged for chips, and the chips earned by the player are used as
            income.</p>
        Play by yourself and earn chips.<br>
        It is not a gamble like baccarat, where you predict the winners of other players.<br>
        While most gambling is between the player and the house, in the case of poker it is between the customers
        sitting at the table, and the house receives an "ante" or a percentage of the winning chips as a commission.<br>
        Unlike other casino games, the promoter does not participate in gambling, but rather provides a table for guests
        to compete with each other and services such as game progression.<br>
        競技(トーナメント)If the game is played as a "game," the entry fee is paid, all participants are given the same amount
        of chips, and the final ranking is determined by the number of chips remaining.<br>
        Prize money is paid according to rank, as in sporting competitions.

        <h4>Handling of A in Straight</h4>
        <p>
            In a straight (and straight flush), A can be connected to both K and 2<br>
            That is, both A-2-3-4-5 and 10-J-Q-K-A are considered straight. However, those containing K-A-2, such as
            Q-K-A-2-3, are not considered straight.<br>
            Also, the A-2-3-4-5 straight (sometimes also known as wheel or bicycle) has an A in it, but is not stronger
            than the 2-3-4-5-6 straight.<br>
            WHEL is the weakest of the straights, a 5-high straight.<br>
            However, in the exceptional game of pai gow poker, A-2-3-4-5 is considered the next strongest straight after
            10-J-Q-K-A.
        </p>
        <h4>Strength of the same role when the same role is created.</h4>
        <p>
            When two players make identical roles, the strength of the hand is determined as follows<br>
            The strength of the card is A>K>Q>J>10>... >2.
        <ol><!--段落番号にCSSで変換-->
            <li>First, compare the ranks of the "major parts" of the hand (the cards that are paired for one pair, the
                stronger of the paired cards for two pair, the cards that are triplets for three of a kind or full
                house, the cards that are quadruplets for four of a kind, and the strongest card for no pair, straight
                flush, or straight flush), both large and small.</li>
            <li>(Two pair and full house only) If the major parts are the same, the ranks of the semi-major parts (the
                weaker of the paired cards in the case of two pair, or the two cards not in a trio in the case of full
                house) are compared in terms of their ranks.</li>
            <li>If it is the same, compare the highest ranking card among the kickers (remaining cards).</li>
            <li>Compare the ranks of the second, third, and fourth highest bills in the following order.</li>
            <li>If these are all equal, the game is considered a tie.</li>
        </ol>
        In the event of a tie, the chips wagered are divided equally among the players tied for first place.<br>
        However, if there are fractions that are not divisible by the chip units being used at the time, the general
        rule is that such fractions are given to the person who should take action first (this is described as the
        "person in the worst position").<br>
        Usually, the suits of the cards are not taken into account and only the ranks are compared, but some old
        Japanese commentaries state that the suits of the cards are compared. In Chinese stud poker, it is also common
        to compare even the suits (♠>♡>♣>♢ is the usual order).<br>
        Even in Europe and the United States, the suits are sometimes compared outside of casinos, but the order of
        their strength and weakness is not standardized.<br>
        When determining the order in which to perform actions (in stud games, etc.) rather than determining the winner,
        etc., even the strength of the suit (♠ > ♡ > ♢ > ♣) is compa<br>
        </p>
        <h3>dealer</h3>
        <p>
            In casinos, there is one dedicated dealer employed by the casino at each poker table, and this dealer deals
            the cards in every game.<br>
            In tournaments and large private games, "amusement dealers" are responsible for game progression and other
            activities.<br>
            In private games that are not large (e.g., in ordinary homes), one of the players often doubles as the
            dealer.<br>
            There is no set rule as to which player becomes the dealer, but usually one of the following four methods is
            used to determine the dealer
        <ol><!--段落番号にCSSで変換-->
            <li>The person to the left of the dealer in the previous game becomes the dealer in the next game.</li>
            <li>The winner of the previous game becomes the dealer of the next game.</li>
            <li>A fixed specific player becomes the dealer.</li>
            <li>As in casinos, the person who does not play becomes the dealer.</li>
        </ol>
        Which rules will be used to determine the dealer will be discussed among the players in advance.<br>
        In flop (community card) poker, a plate marked "DEALER" is often moved clockwise from game to game (this plate
        is called the "dealer button") as a standard for starting to deal cards and forcing bets.
        </p>
        <h3>Tip type</h3>
        <p>The type of chip and its value can be determined at the discretion of the players, and there are no specific
            rules. In many foreign casinos, white = 1, red = 5, green = 25, and black = 100, so these colors and values
            are often used.</p>
        <h4>Color of poker chips</h4>
        <p>
            There are no international standards for poker chip value and color rules.<br>
            Not only do they vary from country to country and region to region, but they can also vary from facility to
            facility or even from single facility to event type.<br>
            Chips may be designated by the local casino regulatory authority to ensure uniformity in color and size.<br>
            For example, uniform colors are designated in New Jersey and Illinois.<br>
            Nevada has no regulations on color, so Nevada casinos (like Las Vegas) use white, blue, and gray for $1
            chips. The governments of all states in the United States where casinos are legal require that the
            combination of edge patterns not overlap depending on the casino store or chip value.

        <h3>pot</h3>
        <p>
            In poker, the area near the center of the table is used as a place to place betting chips. This place to
            place chips is called the pot.<br>
            Players place their bets close to themselves in the pot, distinguishable from chips bet by other
            players.<br>
            At the end of each deal, players may not put chips back in their hands once they have bet, except when the
            winner of the deal receives them.
        </p>
        <h3>anty</h3>
        <p>
            The participation fee, which everyone participating in play must pay a certain amount before each game
            begins, is called an ante.<br>
            Whether or not an ante is required is determined in advance by the game.<br>
            Stud games are usually set up to pay ante, but this is not always necessary in other games.<br>
            The paid ante is collected in the pot (some houses collect the ante as a commission and do not enter the
            pot) and is won by the winner along with subsequent multipliers.
        </p>
        <h3>bet</h3>
        <p>
            In poker, there are several periods during the game for betting (wagering).<br>
            Each of these periods is called a betting interval (or betting round).<br>
            Each betting interval shall be as follows<br>
            The betting interval starts with one of the players (the player to the left of the dealer button in a flop
            game) and runs clockwise.<br>
            In poker, a player can get out of the game (also expressed as fold, down, or drop) at any time during the
            game.<br>
            The player who folds is considered to have lost the deal.<br>
            The player participating in the deal who has not yet folded is called the active player. Thereafter, the
            deal is made by the active player only.<br>
            When a player folds, he or she cannot get back the chips wagered on the deal.<br>
            The player who folded keeps the chips he or she bet on the deal, and the winner of the deal gets them at the
            end of the deal.<br>
            Example: If you bet 25 points and then get out as a result of a raise from your opponent, your initial bet
            of 25 chips goes into the pot.<br>
            Each betting interval is divided into two parts: before and after the opening bet.<br>
            Before the opening bet, each active player takes one of the following actions when it is his/her turn.
        <ul>
            <li>Check.</li>
            <li>Opening bets.</li>
            <li>Fold.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>check</h3>
        <p>
            A check is to pass the bet for that round.<br>
            Instead of declaring "check," the player who checks can also lightly tap the table a couple of times to
            indicate his or her intention to check.<br>
            An opening bet is a chip bet on the pot.<br>
            If everyone checks, the game proceeds to the next step.<br>
            After the opening bet has been made, each active player takes one of the following actions when it is
            his/her turn
        <ul>
            <li>Calling.</li>
            <li>Raise.</li>
            <li>Fold.</li>
        </ul>
        The active player must either multiply or fold by the same or more amount as the previous player when it is
        his/her turn.<br>
        Betting the same amount of chips as the previous player is called a call, and raising the bet is called a
        raise.<br>
        The betting interval continues until all active players have checked, or until all active players have equaled
        the amount of chips they have put up.
        </p>
        <h3>blind bed</h3>
        <p>
            In flop (community card) poker, play is often conducted without collecting the above mentioned antes, but
            since this provides the option of getting off all hands that are not competitive, the rule exists that two
            players clockwise from the player on whom the aforementioned dealer button is placed will be forced to bet
            one unit and two The rule exists that the two players clockwise from the player who placed the dealer button
            are forced to bet (before cards are dealt) one unit and two units of chips, respectively. Bets made at this
            time are called "blind bets.<br>
            However, the presence of blind bets does not necessarily mean that ante does not exist, and games with both
            ante and blind bets are possible and do exist.
        </p>
        <h3>Upper limit of bets</h3>
        <p>
            The type of game in which a limit is set on the amount that can be bet or raised so that the game does not
            go to the blue ceiling is called a limit game.<br>
            Conversely, a game in which no limit is set at all is called a no-limit game (sometimes abbreviated as "NL,"
            "N/L," etc.).<br>
            There are variations on how to limit the value of the raise, such as
        </p>
        <h4>Fixed limit</h4>
        <p>
            Only a certain pre-determined amount can be increased.<br>
            When simply described as "limit," this "fixed limit" is often referred to.
        </p>
        <h4>Spread limit</h4>
        <p>
            For example, "any amount can be increased in the range of $1 to $5," with a certain range.<br>
            It is sometimes employed in low money games, but rarely in tournaments. </p>
        <h4>Pot limit</h4>
        <p>
            The rule is that the total amount in the pot is the maximum amount that can be bet.
        </p>
        <h4>No limit</h4>
        <p>
            A rule that does not set a limit on the amount of money that can be bet or raised.
