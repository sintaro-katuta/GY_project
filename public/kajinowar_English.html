        <h1>What is Casino War?</h1>
        <p>
            American card game.<br>
            It is said to have originated in the late 1990s in casinos in the United States.<br>
            It is a simple and straightforward game in which the game is won by the number of cards dealt to the dealer
            and the player, one at a time.
        </p>
        <h1>basic rule</h1>
        <p>
            The strength of the playing card numbers is the same as the rules of a basic card game, where A is the
            strongest and 2 is the weakest.<br>
            The dealer (parent) deals cards to himself and to the opposing player (child), one face down each.<br>
            Also, bet (wager points) on the ante (score).<br>
            The winner is the one who declares the game and has the higher number of cards on each other's cards. If the
            parent's number is higher, the child collects the number of points wagered, and if the child wins, the child
            gets twice the number of points wagered from the parent.<br>
            In the event of a tie, the player may choose to pay half of the wagered score or choose a War.<br>
            If the latter is selected, the game can be repeated with a further wager of the same number of points as the
            wager.<br>
            If the parent wins that game, it collects all of the child's points, and if the child wins, it gets twice
            the number of points from the parent that it wagered in that case.<br>
            If the second game is also a draw, the child's bet is returned as is.<br>
            You can also bet on a draw, in which case the score you get from the parent is 10 times the number of points
            you bet.
