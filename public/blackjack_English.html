        <h1>What is Blackjack?</h1>
        <img src="./images/blackjack.jpg">
        <p>
            Blackjack is a type of game that uses playing cards. It is a popular card game played in casinos along with
            poker and baccarat.<br>
            The goal is for the player to get a higher score than the dealer, so that the total score of the cards does
            not exceed 21 points.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h1>basic rule</h1>
        <p>
            Players play one-on-one with the dealer (torso). If there is more than one player, the dealer will play with
            more than one player at the same time.<br>
            The goal of each player is to bring the total number of cards in his hand closer to 21, not to exceed 21,
            and to have that number exceed that of the dealer.<br>
            The score of the cards in the hand is the value of the card 2~10, as indicated by the number, and the
            picture cards K (King), Q (Queen) and J (Jack) are counted as 10. A (Ace) can be counted as 1 or 11,
            whichever is more convenient.<br>
            After each player has placed his or her initial bet, the dealer deals two cards to each participant,
            including himself or herself.</p>
        One of the dealer's two cards is turned face up (upcard) for all to see. The other card is face down.<br>
        The face-down card is called the hole card.<br>
        The dealer's second card is turned face up only after all the player's actions have been completed.<br>
        Players' cards may be dealt face-up or face-down, depending on the casino, but in the current mainstream rules
        that use six or more decks, the cards are usually dealt face-up.<br>
        At this point, if the player has 21 (possible only if one of the cards is a combination of 10, J, Q, or K and
        the other is A), it is called "natural 21" or "natural blackjack"; if the dealer does not have 21, the player
        receives a payout of 2.5 times his bet.<br>
        The player has the choice of hit or stand. Some rules employ additional rules besides hit and stand.
        </p>
        <h3>Hit</h3>
        <p>
            Draw another card.<br>
            Action: Tapping on the table or beckoning towards you.
        </p>
        <h3>Stand/Stay</h3>
        <p>
            The game is played on the current score without drawing cards.<br>
            Action: Swing horizontally with palms facing down.<br>
            A player can hit as many times as he/she wants as long as he/she does not exceed 21.<br>
            If the number exceeds 21, it is called a bust, and the player loses immediately.<br>
            When all players stand, the dealer opens his hole cards.<br>
            The dealer must draw cards until his hand reaches 17 or more, after which he cannot draw any additional
            cards (even if his hand starts out with 17 or more).<br>
            If the dealer exceeds 21, all players who did not bust win.<br>
            If the player and the dealer have the same score, the game is a tie. However, some casinos hit when the
            dealer has a soft 17 (A is included and the A is counted as 11 and the total is 17) (even in this case, a
            soft 18 or hard 17 will result in a stand).<br>
            At first glance, the game seems to favor the player with the most options, but the rules actually put the
            player at a disadvantage, such as the possibility of a bust if another card is drawn when the player is
            dealt two cards and the hard 12 or higher, and the player loses if both cards burst.
