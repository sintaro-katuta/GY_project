        <h1>What is money weheel?</h1>
        <p>
            It is a type of casino game of chance.<br>
            The game consists of dividing the surface into a number of equal sections radially from the center, driving
            metal stakes vertically into the areas near the perimeter of the boundaries to define the sections, mounting
            the disks vertically on a support pole, and rotating them to predict which section will stop at a given
            position.<br>
            Also called big six (big6) or wheel of fortune.<br>
            It is often used not only in casinos, but also in events and scenes like amusement park attractions.
        </p>
        <h1>basic rule</h1>
        <p>
            Each section of the disk has one of several different symbols on it, and the same symbols are also on the
            betting table, so the player places a wager on the symbol he expects to stop in a given position.<br>
            You can bet on any number of places.<br>
            When all players have completed their bets, the dealer spins the disc.<br>
            At the apex of the support column that holds the rotating disk is a tongue called a clapper made of leather
            and felt that hangs down from the front of the disk. While the disk is rotating, a metal stake driven into
            the disk continuously strikes the clapper, producing the game's distinctive sound.<br>
            When the disk finally stops, the clapper inevitably stays in the middle of the two piles, and the symbol
            depicted in that compartment becomes the winning symbol.<br>
            The dealer pays a predetermined payout for bets on this symbol and collects bets on other symbols.
        </p>
        <h3>About Equipment</h3>
        <p>
            Gaming equipment standards vary from country to country, region to region, or casino to casino.<br>
            In the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, the face of the disk, which is at least 1.5 meters in
            diameter, is divided equally into 52 compartments, and seven different symbols are assigned to each
            compartment. In North America, most of these compartments are 54 in number.
        </p>
        <h3>About the Symbol</h3>
        <p>
            In most cases, the odds number itself is depicted as a symbol.<br>
            Odds, like the standard of gaming equipment, are not constant from region to region or casino to casino.<br>
            In the UK example, there are seven different symbols: 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50(A), 50(B), and these symbols are
            allocated 24, 12, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 1 respectively for the 52 compartments.
        </p>
        <h1>important point</h1>
        <p>
            The money wheel in Australia and New Zealand has a constant expected value for all symbols, while in the
            United Kingdom and the United States the expected value varies from symbol to symbol.<br>
            In the UK, the expected value of a bet on the highest payout of 50x is the highest, an exception to the rule
            that many games set lower expectations for higher odds.<br>
            In the U.S., it is difficult to make a general statement because each casino has different settings, but in
            general, it is recognized as a game with low expectations and poor odds among the games played in
            casinos.<br>
            However, because the rules are simple, the game is suitable as a lighthearted game for general customers who
            are not familiar with the game, and some casinos have installed the casino in a position where they can be
            seen from the street outside, hoping that the sight of such customers enjoying the game will have the effect
            of becoming a sign of the casino.
