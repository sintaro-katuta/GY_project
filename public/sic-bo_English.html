        <h1>What is Sic Bo?</h1>
        <p>
            Dasho or daisai (Cantonese: taisai) is a betting game in which three dice are used to predict the total
            number of rolls, etc.<br>
            Also called Sic-Bo.<br>
            This is mainly done in casinos in Asia (especially Macau).
        </p>
        <h1>basic rule</h1>
        <p>
            Since three dice are used, the minimum total number of rolls is 3 (1's) and the maximum number is 18 (6's),
            and the total number of rolls of the three dice is between 4 and 10 (small) and between 11 and 17 (large).
            The minimum number of 3 and the maximum number of 18 are classified as neither "big" nor "small" according
            to the rules of "big" and "small".<br>
            Unlike relatively similar roulette, the dice are contained in a fully sealed machine container with a lid a
            double lid with an opaque removable outer lid and a fixed transparent inner lid. The dice are shuffled by
            the machine with the outer lid removed (the dice are not accessible when the outer lid is removed), the bets
            are placed by placing chips on the table in anticipation of the payout after the payout is determined (as in
            roulette, the placement of chips indicates anticipation), and then the outer lid is opened to disclose the
            payout.
        </p>
        <h3>Forecast Classification</h3>
        <p>
            There are the following six categories of forecasts, which also have different multipliers when they are
            correct.<br>
            Magnification is based on British standards.<br>
            In Macau casinos, the multiplier is lower than this (e.g., 151 times if you hit a particular Zoroji).<br>
            The notation on this page includes a lump sum in the Japanese style, but the original notation does not
            include a lump sum.
        <ul>
            <li>Guess whether the answer is "large" or "small." If you guess right, it is doubled.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>However, Zoro is an independent category that is neither large nor small.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The one that guesses whether the number is "even" or "odd". If you guess right, the number is
                doubled.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>However, Zoro is an independent category that is neither even nor odd.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The total number of rolls of the dice is from 4 to 17. Even if the total number of rolls is correct, it
                is considered to be a miss if the roll is a zero. 6, 9, 12, and 15 are each one less than the number of
                combinations.
                <ul>
                    <li>3 and 18 are not in this category because they are included in the category that makes you guess
                        the zeros of 1 and 6.</li>
                    <li>
                        The payout varies depending on the payout. The payout percentage is written along with the
                        expected payout at the place where you place your chips.<br>
                        The outer (closer to 3.18) is the higher the payout. If it hits, it pays 7x to 61x.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The game is played with one of the three dice (called a "single" or "straight"). (This is called a
                single or straight, the same meaning as a roulette straight).<br>
                The payout is higher for a 2 or a 3 (three) bets (e.g., betting on the 1's and getting a 123 pays 2x,
                114 pays 3x, and 111 pays 4x).
            </li>
            <li>
                A game in which the players are asked to predict the roll of two of the three dice.<br>
                If you hit a double (two identical eyes, e.g., 11, 33, etc., except for a triplet), it is multiplied by
                12. If you hit a double (two identical eyes, e.g., 11, 33, etc., except for a triplet), it is multiplied
                by 12, and a combination (two different eyes, e.g., 12, 26) by 7.
            </li>
            <li>
                The one that makes you guess Zorro's eyes.<br>
                There are two ways to wager: one is to simply guess that it is a Zoro (31x if it is right), and the
                other is to guess a specific Zoro number (181x if it is right).
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>dividend</h3>
        <p>
            It is one of the most popular forms of gambling in Macau's casinos, and most casinos have tables of various
            sizes.<br>
            The minimum bet is generally 50 patacas (or the approximate equivalent of HK$50) for a bet on the size of an
            eye, and 20 patacas (or HK$20) for a bet on any other part of the eye, making it one of the most affordable
            types of casino games in Macau.<br>
            However, there are very few 50-pataca tables, and most tables have a minimum wager of at least 300 patacas.
